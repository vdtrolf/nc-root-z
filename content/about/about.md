### Our Story

We all are in the midst of a climate and ecological breakdown. We are facing an uncertain future – our world is in crisis and life itself is under threat. 

There is no time and every single step can make a change: on the street, on the web, and behind that web. At Faircolibri we are experienced IT engineers and we are active for the climate. We want to use that experience to help organisations reduce carbon footprint, and promote via their IT climate justice and inclusivity.

The name **"Fair Colibri"** litearlly means **"Fair Hummingbird"** in french and is inspired by the legend of that little bird who decided to save the forest. 

### We are driven by values

Our values ​​are those rules that we consider indisputable, non-negotiable, and that define us:
* We protect the world of tomorrow
* We fight for justice
* We accept each human being as she/he/it is
* We are generous and open

### The Legend of the Hummingbird

One day, a long time ago and in a faraway place, or so the legend goes, there was a huge forest fire that was raging the countryside. All the animals were terrified, running around in circles, screaming, crying and helplessly watching the impending disaster.

But there in the middle of the flames, and above the cowering animals, was a tiny hummingbird busy flying from a small pond to the fire, each time fetching a few drops with its beak to throw on the flames. And then again And then again.

After a while, an old grouchy armadillo, annoyed by this ridiculous useless agitation on the part of the hummingbird, cried out: “Tiny bird! Don’t be a fool. It is not with those miniscule drops of water one after the other that you are going to put out the fire and save us all! ”

To which the hummingbird replied, _“Could be, but I’m going to do my bit”_.

### A final word

_“Maybe we need to re-engage our smart, energetic youth around the world to be farmers and find fresh, green technologies that will feed the world more fresh greens”_
